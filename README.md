# Voxel-Art
__Voxel Art Plugin__ â€” This is a tool that allows you to create entire worlds that you can modify directly in game mode. Landscapes can be completely different shapes, flat, ribbed, planetary, dune, it all depends on your imagination. Voxels can be not only cubic, but also smoothed. Which allows you to unleash your full creative potential, as well as enjoy the speed and great functionality of the plugin.

All of you know the game of mancraft, and what fantastic things you can make inside this amazing game. The world itself inside of minecraft is made up of voxels - cubes, but the voxels themselves can have completely different shapes. The Voxel Art plugin gives you the opportunity to create your own game with completely bizarre shapes and landscapes, in totally different styles. And the smart multi-threading and generation optimisation allows you to exploit the full potential of your computer power.
